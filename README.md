# 🌟 AJ - AI & Quantum Computing Speech Therapy App

![Project Banner](public/images/space_bg.png)  
*(Note: This banner represents the Quantum Adventure theme)*

> **"Empowering Arabic-speaking children to find their voice through Artificial Intelligence & Quantum Mechanics."**

**AJ** is a revolutionary gamified speech therapy platform designed specifically for Arabic-speaking children. By combining **OpenAI's Whisper Model** for real-time pronunciation analysis with a **Quantum Computing Backend (Qiskit)** for truly random reward generation, we transform tedious therapy sessions into an exciting treasure hunt.

## The Problem & Solution

### 🔴 The Problem
- **Accessibility:** Speech therapy in Palestine is expensive with long waiting lists.
- **Engagement:** Traditional repetition exercises are boring for children.
- **Language Gap:** Most AI speech tools do not support specific Arabic phonemes (like 'Qaf', 'Ra', 'Sin').

### 🟢 The Solution (AJ)
**AJ** acts as a pocket-sized AI therapist. It uses gamification to keep children engaged and advanced speech recognition to provide instant, gentle feedback. We introduce **Quantum Computing** to the mix to teach children about science while ensuring fair, non-deterministic rewards.

## Key Features ✨

### 🎮 Gamified Adventures
- **Dual Tutors:** Children choose their guide—**Aws** or **Joud**—creating an emotional connection.
- **Story Mode:** A treasure hunt where unlocking the chest requires correct pronunciation.

### 🎯 Personalized Practice Park
- **Dynamic Learning:** The app remembers which letters the child struggles with (e.g., swapping 'K' for 'T').
- **Targeted Training:** Automatically unlocks specific exercises for diagnosed issues (e.g., "The Letter K Module").

### 🏆 The Quantum Chest
- A reward system that exists in **Superposition**.
- Opening the chest "collapses" the quantum state to reveal either a **Legendary** or **Common** prize based on true quantum randomness.

## Quantum Intelligence ⚛️

Unlike standard apps that use pseudo-random numbers (algorithms), **AJ** uses **True Randomness** generated by a Quantum Circuit.

**How it works:**
1. **Superposition:** We initialize a Qubit and apply a **Hadamard Gate (H)**. This puts the prize in a state of being both "Legendary" and "Common" simultaneously  
   ($|0\rangle + |1\rangle$).
2. **Measurement:** When the child clicks "Open", we measure the Qubit.
3. **Collapse:** The wave function collapses to a single state (0 or 1), determining the prize.

*This feature runs on a local Python Flask server using **Qiskit**.*

## AI Speech Engine 🤖

We utilize **OpenAI Whisper (Large-v3)** via Server Actions to analyze audio.

1. **Recording:** The child's voice is recorded in high-quality WebM format.
2. **Processing:** The audio is sent securely to OpenAI.
3. **Comparison:** We compare the transcribed text against the target phonemes using Levenshtein distance logic to detect subtle pronunciation errors in Arabic.
